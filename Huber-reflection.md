#Reflections on Git and GitHub
##My first GPS!

**Prior to the GPS Session:**

Still completing the Week One Git assignments, I was still early in digesting the process.  I'd watched the video and was only beginning to take notes the second time through it.  I felt comfortable with the concepts, but was unfamiliar with commands and procedures.

**During the GPS Session**

The basic process is much more clear.  We talked about ideas for proper commit messages.  I began the session thinking of branches more like folders because of how they appear in the terminal, but became much more comfortable understanding what was happening going between branches.  Also, I had read about merge conflicts on Slack, but my pair and I created a simple one that explained it well.  It looks like separation of responsibilities between project-mates is helpful!

My pair had a better handle going in than I did, so, navigating, I probably put a lot of my direction in the form of questions!  I asked the guide a lot of syntax questions as I get more comfortable with that.

**Lingering Questions of Git**

The fetch command seemed new.  As I wrote, I'm not done with the section yet, but I didn't recognize that.  My pair, Daniel, and I had questions on steps going to and from GitHub.  In addition to fetch, for instance, we had a couple questions when setting up pull requests as to which source and destination to select.  While I think I'm far more comfortable on the local end (terminal) I need more time with the GitHub interface.

**Take Away From My First GPS**

I thought Alex did a great job of letting us go and gauging when to step in to help solve a problem.  A good example was when a commit wasn't working, he asked us to take a look at the "git add" line, where we had not capitalized "README.md", instead of telling us our error.  Daniel was generous with his ideas and knowelege having a firmer grasp on the subject and very straightforward.  I appreciated near the end when I kind of skipped over a discussion point that seemed obvious to me and he asked if we could step back and talk for a moment about it.  I will be better prepared next time.
