#GPS 1.1 - Release 7: Reflect

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

* Although, the process of pushing, pull request, and merging was a bit complicating at first, after many reviews, it all made sense. I guess only thing I struggled with was that there was no guideline available to setup a good commit message.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

* The pair and guide had a good sense of how to come up with a good commit message. They both explained well helped me to get a good grasp on how to make a good message.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

* Right after the guide left, we encountered the fetch command, in which neither me or the pair had any idea on how to handle the command. It was ver new to us because neither of us were previously exposed to the command.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

* There were times when both the pair and I were struggling and expected the guide to come in and solve the problem for us but I am glad he held back and let the pair come up with a solution. Greg, the pair, was very informative on his navigations and I could not have done better by myself. Now, I am clarified on the concept of pairing. There are many more pairings to be had and this was the perfect first stepping stone.
